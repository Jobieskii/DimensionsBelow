# DimensionsBelow
A Minecraft mod that runs on the serverside using [Polymer](https://polymer.pb4.eu/0.3.x/). It adds 2 new blocks, cracked bedrock and bedrock portal (tunnel). The former naturally generates on the last bedrock layer and when broken turns into the latter. The portal block teleports to the respective position in the next dimension under the bedrock roof. The list of dimensions can be customized and extended (e.g. with custom datapack dimensions) that also have a bedrock roof.

Not yet released.
